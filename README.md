## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned/recapped some SVG - even though the style guide recommended font icons, I opted for inline SVGs, since they're becoming a more common solution for inline icons. SVGs provide for better accessibility (even though here I aria-hid them), as well as styling hooks for hover/focus styles through `fill` property etc.

### Continued development

It's probably worth spending more time in planning stage - that's what I plan on doing going forward.
